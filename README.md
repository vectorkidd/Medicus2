A doctor appointment booking system developed for university minor project.
This is a dummy doctor appointment system which consists of two portals, patient and doctor.
The users are supposed to login by registering into the system by initially providing their fullname and email address. We use Firebase authentication system for verifying the user's identity. 
The complete details of the users(doctor and patient) is stored using MySQL database on a localhost server.
The app also provides location services which will display the location of the particular hospital or clinic.
