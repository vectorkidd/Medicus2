1)Adhesive tape\n
2)Alcohol wipes\n
3)Allergy medicine\n
4)Aloe vera gel\n
5)Antibiotic ointment\n
6)Bandages in different sizes\n

        How do I treat a minor cut or scrape?\n

Follow these steps to keep cuts clean and prevent infections and scars.\n

1)Wash your hands.\n First, wash up with soap and water so you don’t get bacteria into the cut and cause an infection. If you’re on the go, use hand sanitizer.\n
2)Stop the bleeding.\n Put pressure on the cut with a gauze pad or clean cloth. Keep the pressure on for a few minutes.\n
3)Clean the wound. Once you’ve stopped the bleeding, rinse the cut under cool running water or use a saline wound wash. Clean the area around the wound with soap and a wet washcloth. Don’t get soap in the cut, because it can irritate the skin. And don’t use hydrogen peroxide or iodine, which could irritate the cut.\n
4)Remove any dirt or debris.\n Use a pair of tweezers cleaned with alcohol to gently pick out any dirt, gravel, glass, or other material in the cut.\n\n
